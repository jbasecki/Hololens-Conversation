# Hololens-Conversation
transmits thoughts using silent Holographic Images, brain 2 brain.


Hololens Conversation?

Holographic Image System (SATOsum language)
is a direct translation from English to abstract images (3D thoughts)

A Star-Wars-Like  conversation, SATOsum,
transmits thoughts using silent Holographic Images, brain 2 brain.

However there is a non-silent version as well.
SATOsum may be used with oral signals such as English in the background
and as such makes Double Modality Conversation (DMC) possible.

DMC is a new territory, a path never traveled before by a human brain.
Therefore it provides opportunities to test memory and cognition
from a new perspective, aiming to enhance the Next Generation Thinkers.

SATOsum may be seen as Civilization-1 Info Transmitter (with "in-brain-monitor") *
created by work/play of many (blockchain based). 

First products: STORIES FOR KIDS translated to SATOsum (for immediate use and enjoyment).

What is in the name:

Sato - a person using satosum
Sato-sum - a group using satosum
Satos - coin
Sat - 3D icon representing a thought unit
sum - a number of users to date

_____
* Observe that the oral and written information is processed in a very different area of brain
and in a different manner. Thus we should recognize that it is likely that the written constructs
(text) are not optimized for the rapid multi-modal character of cognition.

Needed: Ethereum skilled programmer & designer as well as SL speakers and parent-child teams as story-readers-experimenters
Initially the images are holographic translations from Sign Language using six sense technology or similar. Organization is similar to Lazooz
where instead of drivers and riders we'd have readers and translators. Programmer would initiate blockchain contract and designer would provide a system 
in which the images would gain uniform and atractive apperance.

There are some concepts proposed for the satos currency which potentially could
solve the "chicken-egg" problem.
